Q. Answer the following questions. Also, explain why do you think that your answer is correct.  
 
var mStr = "This is my test string to practice the JavaScript string function concepts.This is gonna be fun." 
 
 1. Find the length of the first sentence in the string.
 var first = "This is my test string to practice the JavaScript string function concepts".split("");
var lenFirst = first.length;
console.log(lenFirst);

 2. Find the length of the second sentence in the string. 
// var second = "This is gonna be fun".split("");
// var lenSecond = second.length;
// console.log(lenSecond)

 3. Find the first and last occurrence of the word "This". 
 4. Find the sub-string with length 12 from the START of the string mStr.
 Explanation:
substring(indexStart)
substring(indexStart, indexEnd)
Parameters
indexStart
The index of the first character to include in the returned substring.
indexEnd Optional
The index of the first character to exclude from the returned substring.
Return value
A new string containing the specified part of the given string.
Description
substring() extracts characters from indexStart up to but not including indexEnd. In particular:
If indexEnd is omitted, substring() extracts characters to the end of the string.
If indexStart is equal to indexEnd, substring() returns an empty string.
If indexStart is greater than indexEnd, then the effect of substring() is as if the two arguments were swapped; see example below.
Any argument value that is less than 0 or greater than str.length is treated as if it were 0 and str.length, respectively.
Any argument value that is NaN is treated as if it were 0.


 5. Find the sub-string with length 12 from the END of the string mStr.
