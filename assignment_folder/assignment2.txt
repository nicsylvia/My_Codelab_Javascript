Some of the answers:

 4. List out 10 string methods.
1. concat(): Combines the text of two strings and returns a new string. 
2. match(): Used to match a regular expression against a string. 
3. replace(): Used to find a match between a regular expression and a string,
              and to replace the matched substring with a new substring. 
4. search():  Executes the search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. 
5. slice():   Extracts a section of a string and returns a new string. 
6. split():  Splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings. 
7. toLocaleLowerCase(): The characters within a string are converted to lower case while respecting the current locale. 
8. toLocaleUpperCase(): The characters within a string are converted to upper case while respecting the current locale. 
9. toLowerCase(): Returns the calling string value converted to lower case. 
10. valueOf(): Returns the primitive value of the specified object. 
OR *************************************

charAt(index)	returns the character at the specified index
concat()	joins two or more strings
replace()	replaces a string with another string
split()	converts the string to an array of strings
substr(start, length)	returns a part of a string
substring(start,end)	returns a part of a string
slice(start, end)	returns a part of a string
toLowerCase()	returns the passed string in lower case
toUpperCase()	returns the passed string in upper case
trim()	removes whitespace from the strings
includes()	searches for a string and returns a boolean value
search()	searches for a string and returns a position of a match


5. List out 10 array methods.
1. foreach(): This method can help you to loop over array’s items.
2. includes(): This method check if array includes the item passed in the method.
3. splice() Adds and/or removes elements from an array. 
4. map(): This method create new array by calling the provided function in every element.
5. reduce(): This applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right)
             to reduce it to a single value.
6. some(): This method check if at least one of array’s item passed the condition. If passed, 
           it return ‘true’ otherwise ‘false’.
7. every(): This method check if all array’s item passed the condition. If passed, it return ‘true’ otherwise ‘false’.
8. sort(): This method used to arrange/sort array’s item either ascending or descending order.
9. pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element. 
10. reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements of an array -- the first becomes the last,
               and the last becomes the first. 

6. List out 10 object methods.
1. Object.create(): You can also create object with Object.create() function this has additional flexibility that you
                     can choose what will be prototype of your new object.
2. Object.entries(): This is a simple function which converts JS objects to an array of arrays.
                    With inner array is pair of key and value of the object.                    
3. Object.keys(): This function picks only keys (or property labels) of objects and returns an array.
4. Object.freeze(): This function freezes the object for any further changes (key or values). 
                    It may not throw any error (unless you are in strict mode) but there will be no effect of 
                    value change on your object.
5. Object.values(): This function picks only values of objects and returns an array
6. Object.freeze(): This function freezes the object for any further changes (key or values).
                     It may not throw any error (unless you are in strict mode) but there will be no effect of value
                      change on your object.
7. object.seal(): In JavaScript prevents from adding new properties to an object. It’s similar to Object.freeze(),
                         the only difference is that it allows you to update and change properties inside an object.

8. object.is(): The method Object.is() is another useful JavaScript object method that defines if two values are the same.
                 It returns true if both values are equal. Otherwise, it returns false.

8. List out four number methods and know 3 of their uses.
1. toString(): Returns the string representation of the number's value. 
2. valueOf(): Returns the number's value. 
3. toPrecision(): Defines how many total digits (including digits to the left and right of the decimal)
                 to display of a number. 
4. toFixed(): Formats a number with a specific number of digits to the right of the decimal.
