1. The charAt() method takes the index value
  as an argument and returns the corresponding character from the calling string.
   An index value of a string starts with 0, which means the first character has an index value of 0,
  the second character has an index value of 1, and so on.

  The default index value in the charAt method is 0.
If the index value is out of range then it returns an empty string ('').
If the index can not be converted to an integer then this method returns the first character of the string.

2. The charCodeAt string method in javascript returns the Unicode value (between 0 and 65535) of the character present 
at the given index of the string. Example Unicode value of 'A' is 65.
The charCodeAt() method takes an index as an argument and returns the Unicode value of the character present 
at that index value.The default value of the index is 0.
 If the index value is not given or it can't be converted to a string the 0 is used by default.
If the index value is out of range then this method returns NaN.

3. concat in javascript
The concat string method in javascript concatenates the passed string in the method to the calling string and returns
 the concatenated string as a new string.
The concat() method can take any number of strings as an argument.
If the passed argument is not a string then it converts the argument to string and then concatenates it.

4. endsWith in javascript
The endsWith string method in javascript is used to determines whether the string ends with a specified substring or not.
If it ends with a specified string then it returns true, else returns false.
The substring to be checked for the ending is passed as the first argument in the method.

5The includes also accept an optional second argument which determines the position from where the method starts searching within the string

The default value of the second argument is 0.
