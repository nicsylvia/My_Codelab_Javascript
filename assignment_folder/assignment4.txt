1. Find the length of the first sentence in the string.
2. Find the length of the second sentence in the string. 
3. Find the first and last occurrence of the word "This". 
4. Find the sub-string with length 12 from the START of the string mStr.
5. Find the sub-string with length 12 from the END of the string mStr. 


The difference between substring() and substr():
The two parameters of :
substr() are start and length.
while for substring() are start and end.
 
string.substr(start, length)

 start: The position where to start the extraction, index starting from 0. 
 length: The number of characters to extract (optional).

string.substring(start, end)

 start: The position where to start the extraction, index starting from 0. 
 end: The position (up to, but not including) where to end the extraction (optional).

 substr() Vs. substring()
The difference is in the second argument. The second argument to substring is the index to stop at (but not include),
 but the second argument to substr is the maximum length to return. 
Moreover, substr() accepts a negative starting position as an offset from the end of the string. substring() does not.

There are two String manipulation functions in JavaScript, namely,
 substr() and substring(), that are used to get a substring from a String. However, there are slight differences 
 between subst() and substring() methods.

Both functions take two parameters, but substr()
takes the length of the substring to be returned, while substring takes end index (excluding) for a substring.
